# LUSCA
Lusca – FIJI (ImageJ) based tool for automated morphological analysis of cellular and subcellular structures.
#
ABOUT:
This macro implements a machine learning tool for image segmentation, which enables better segmentation of pixels for the analysis of noisy images or images with low contrast of desired objects compared to the background. Furthermore, it offers many possibilities for morphological image analysis (area or volume, number, intensity, length, width, and colocalization of segmented objects). Due to the special procedure of image segmentation, it is also capable of analyzing other biological structures recorded with different techniques (immunocytochemistry, MRA, in vitro cultures), such as blood vessels, and cellular organelles.
#
INSTALLATION:
1. Download the file “Lusca_PC.ijm” or “Lusca_MAC.ijm” from GitHub depending on the operating system of your computer.
2. Put the macro file into the folder “plugins” of FIJI.
3. Restart FIJI. Lusca should appear at the bottom of the Plugins menu.
4. Before using Lusca, please check and install if necessary, the plugin “LocalThickness”, and please add the update sites “Neuroanatomy” and “ImageScience” in FIJI.
