ABOUT:
This plugin implements machine learning tool for image segmentation, which enables better division of pixels for the analysis on noisy images or images with low contrast of desired objects compared to the background. Furthermore, it offers User many possibilities for morphological image analysis (area or volume, number, intensity, length, width, and colocalization of segmented objects). Due to the special procedure of image segmentation, it is also capable of analyzing other biological structures recorded with different techniques (immunocytochemistry, MRA, in vitro cultures), such as blood vessels, cellular organelles.
